# COMSW411: Semester-Project-College-Registration-System (Fall 2024)

A Python-based web server built as part of Columbia Universityâ€™s CS4111: Introduction to Databases (Fall 2024).
Developed in collaboration with my teammate Yang Zhang, this project implemented a scalable college registration system supporting three user groups: students, professors, and administrators. The system integrated multiple relational databases and supported core features including: Course enrollment and add/drop, waitlist management, conflict detection and resolution, grade submission, administrative reporting, etc. 

NOTE: The project was originally designed to work with PostgreSQL, where our database server was hosted. Since the course has ended, our PostgreSQL access has expired, so the live database integration is no longer active.

ðŸ“Œ Recognition: This project was ranked Top 3 out of 200 projects in CS4111 (Fall 2024), recognized by Professor Luis Gravano.
